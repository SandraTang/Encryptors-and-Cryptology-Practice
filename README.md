# Encryptors-and-Cryptology-Practice
This repository contains a large number of python files housing automated encrypting and practice games for the caesar, affine, hill, aristocrat, and patristocrat ciphers. Some are in both English and Spanish. 
See them in action on my website <a href="https://sandratang.github.io/cryptography">here</a>.
