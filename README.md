# Encryptors-and-Cryptology-Practice
Automated encrypting and practice games for the caesar, affine, hill, aristocrat, and patristocrat ciphers. 
This repository contains a large number of python files housing the automated encryptors and practice games. 
See these applications and games in action on my website <a href="https://sandratang.github.io/cryptography">here</a>.
